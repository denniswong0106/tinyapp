# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

The homepage:

To access your urls, login first:
!["Login page"](https://github.com/denniswong0106/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/login.png)

If you don't have a login, you can register:
!["register page"](https://github.com/denniswong0106/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/create-account.png)

Excellent! Currently we don't have any urls. So let's start adding some!

Adding a url:
!["create url"](https://github.com/denniswong0106/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/create-new-url.png)

Here is the created url!

Let's add a few more, and see what our homepage looks like now!

Let's try editing a url:
!["edit url"](https://github.com/denniswong0106/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/edit-url.png)

Let's take a look at our homepage again:
!["homepage with 3 urls changed"](https://github.com/denniswong0106/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/homepage-3urls-gmail.png)

What happens if we logout and another user logs in?
